# Toy Robot
The Toy Robot Coding Challenge : 
The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop, of dimensions 5 units x 5 units. The robot is roaming around the surface with no obstructions and also being prevented from falling to destruction.

## Getting Started

Please ensure that all the steps in the installation are followed on your machine. This program only uses the included libraries from the Python distribution. 
To get started, clone the repository and follow the instructions included in the execution section.

### Prerequisites

The coding challenge was completed using the following software:
- Pycharm Community
- Python 3.9


### Installing

Python needs to be installed in order to run the code. Please find the link below to download Python:

## Executing

The program should be executed by running the main.py file contained in the main directory. This can be done by traversing to the game directory and running:
`python3 main.py`

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org) - Programming Language
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - Python IDE

## Future Work
